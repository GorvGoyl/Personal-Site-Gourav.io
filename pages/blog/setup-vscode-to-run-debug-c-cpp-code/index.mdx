> By the end of this short guide, you’d be able to run, debug, and get IntelliSense for C/C++ files in VSCode. Though, this guide is focused on the Windows platform but can be extended to Mac and Linux with some minor changes.

I extensively used C & C++ in my <A href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competitive_programming" text="competitive programming" new={true} />
years and wanted better support for debugging & IntelliSense. The only options available
were <A href="https://orwelldevcpp.blogspot.com" text="Dev-C++" new={true} /> (outdated) and the original "Mammoth"
Visual Studio. Lately, I found VSCode and fell in love with it (first love was Atom).
I tweaked it around and set it up as a complete IDE For small C, C++ projects especially
geared towards competitive programming.

## Create a sample C/C++ project

1. Open/Create an empty folder in VSCode.
2. Create a `new.cpp` file inside it like below:

```cpp:new.cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
 cout << "Hello World" << endl;
 // uncomment below line to stop cmd from exiting immediately in case of "externalConsole": true
 //system("pause");
 return 0;
}
```

3. Install _recommended_ C/C++ extension in VSCode and reload.

## Install C/C++ Compiler

C/C++ extension **does not include** a C++ compiler. So, you will need to install one or use which is already installed on your computer.

**Windows:** Download <A href="https://github.com/gorvgoyl/MinGW64/releases" text="MinGW64.zip" new={true} /> (latest release) and extract it to the C Drive.

**Mac:** <A href="https://developer.apple.com/xcode/" text="XCode" new={true} />

**Linux:** <A text="GCC" href="https://gcc.gnu.org/"  new={true} />

Also, Make sure to add C++ compiler PATH to environment variable of your platform. For Windows MinGW64 add: `C:\MinGW64\bin`

## Run and Debug C/C++ Code

You’ll notice that there is also a `.vscode` folder in your sample project. To configure `debug configuration`, 2 files are required `launch.json` and `tasks.json` inside `.vscode` folder.

VSCode can create and auto-configure these files if we try to debug for the first time. To do that, open C++ file in VSCode and either hit **F5** or go to _Debug -\> Start Debugging_ and select `C++ (GDB/LLDB)` then select `g++.exe build and debug active file`.

<Img src={img2} alt="" caption="Select C++ (GDB/LLDB)" />

<Img src={img3} alt="" caption="Select g++.exe build and debug active file" />

This should create 2 files `launch.json` and `tasks.json` in `.vscode` folder which should look like below (update the MinGW64 path if not correct)

Notice that I’ve added one more optional configuration `g++ build & run active file` in `launch.json` and `g++ build & run` in `tasks.json` file for purpose of also **Running C/C++ code without debugging**. Now you may choose which configuration to pick when you start debugging. You may remove the configuration whichever you won’t need.

### launch.json

```json:launch.json
{
  "version": "0.2.0",
  "configurations": [
    {
      "name": "g++.exe build and debug active file",
      "type": "cppdbg",
      "request": "launch",
      "program": "${fileDirname}\\${fileBasenameNoExtension}.exe",
      "args": [],
      "stopAtEntry": false,
      "cwd": "${workspaceFolder}",
      "environment": [],
      "externalConsole": false, //set to true to see output in cmd instead
      "MIMode": "gdb",
      "miDebuggerPath": "C:\\MinGW64\\bin\\gdb.exe",
      "setupCommands": [
        {
          "description": "Enable pretty-printing for gdb",
          "text": "-enable-pretty-printing",
          "ignoreFailures": true
        }
      ],
      "preLaunchTask": "g++.exe build active file"
    },
    {
      "name": "g++ build & run active file",
      "type": "cppdbg",
      "request": "launch",
      "program": "${fileDirname}\\${fileBasenameNoExtension}.exe",
      "args": [],
      "stopAtEntry": false,
      "cwd": "${workspaceFolder}",
      "environment": [],
      "externalConsole": false, //set to true to see output in cmd instead
      "MIMode": "gdb",
      "miDebuggerPath": "C:\\MinGW64\\bin\\gdb.exe",
      "setupCommands": [
        {
          "description": "Enable pretty-printing for gdb",
          "text": "-enable-pretty-printing",
          "ignoreFailures": true
        }
      ],
      "preLaunchTask": "g++ build & run active file"
    }
  ]
}
```

### tasks.json

```json:tasks.json
{
  "tasks": [
    {
      "type": "shell",
      "label": "g++.exe build active file",
      "command": "C:\\MinGW64\\bin\\g++.exe",
      "args": [
        "-g",
        "${file}",
        "-o",
        "${fileDirname}\\${fileBasenameNoExtension}.exe"
      ],
      "options": {
        "cwd": "C:\\MinGW64\\bin"
      }
    },
    {
      "type": "shell",
      "label": "g++ build & run active file",
      "command": "C:\\MinGW64\\bin\\g++.exe",
      "args": [
        "${file}",
        "-o",
        "${fileDirname}\\${fileBasenameNoExtension}.exe"
      ],
      "options": {
        "cwd": "C:\\MinGW64\\bin"
      }
    }
  ],
  "version": "2.0.0"
}
```

> `externalConsole` in `launch.json` can be set to true to see code output in cmd instead.

**Restart VSCode** to take effects of newly added compiler paths.

Open any C/C++ file, set some breakpoints (or not), and hit the Big Green Play Button.

> (Shortcut to debug: F5 )

<Img src={img5} alt="" caption="Select g++.exe build and debug active file" />

**Tip**: To hide `*.exe` files in the side explorer of VSCode, open settings and paste the below config:

```json
"files.exclude": {
 "*.exe": true
 }
```
